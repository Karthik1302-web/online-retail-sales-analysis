## Key Business Insights

1. United Kingdom contributes the highest number of transactions and revenue, indicating a strong core market.
2. Negative quantity and sales values indicate product returns and refunds, which require operational attention.
3. Sales show a strong upward trend in November and December, suggesting seasonal demand driven by festivals and promotions.
